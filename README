CenturyLink users have to suffer through redirections whenever that user enters a correctly
formed url that still 404's. This script re-redirects the user to Google (or any other searchengine
of their choosing).

Changing the variables in the script will do the following

"pickYourSearchEngine" will change the search engine that redirects. 1 is for Google, 2 is Bing, 3 is Yahoo
This variable exists because there is no way to direct to access the browser's default search. (Firefox
apparently has a way, but not Google Chrome. I didn't want to spaghetti my code detecting browsers.)

"dontRedirectManualSearches" is the variable that controls whether or not searching century link manually
will redirect to your search engine. Changing this value to "true" will stop redirecting manual searches.
